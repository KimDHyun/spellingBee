spellingBee
============
:honeybee: :heavy_plus_sign: :octocat:

The **spellingBee** is your new favorite tool to provide **bangin' spell corrections for your GitHub READMEs**. Upon finding a mapped correction in  ```words/words.txt```, the **Spelling Bee** pull requests your repo with the spelling errors corrected! 

Currently this is local to my machine, so PM me if you want your repo spellingBee'd.

If the corrections suck, let the **Spelling Bee** know by posting an issue [here](https://github.com/dawsonbotsford/spellingBee/issues), and if it reveals a spelling error useful to you, merge that shit! And then star the repo, it goes a long way to help me see my efforts are useful.

```words/words.txt``` is where all of the corrections are mapped. Feel free to pull request improvements to this file if you have a good mapping to add.
