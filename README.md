spellingBee
============

**spellingBee** is your new favorite tool to provide **Bangin' spell corrections for your GitHub READMEs**. Upon finding a mapped correction in  ```/spellingBee/words.txt```, **Dawson's Spelling Bee** pull requests your repo the spelling errors corrected! 

Currently this is local to my machine, so PM me if you want your repo spellingBee'd.

If the corrections suck, let **Dawson's Spelling Bee** know by posting an issue [here](https://github.com/dawsonbotsford/spellingBee/issues), but if it reveals a spelling error useful to you, merge that shit! And then star the repo, it goes a long way to help me see my efforts are useful.

```words/words.txt``` is where all of the corrections are mapped. Feel free to pull request improvements to the word mapping file.
